This project is a machine learning algorithm for the classification of drowsy vs. alert drivers. The algorithm uses facial recognition technology to detect when a driver is becoming drowsy by analyzing eye aspect ratio. The code uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect whether eyes are open or closed, and when the program detects eye aspect ratio below a certain threshold for a certain number of frames, a sound will be played to awaken the driver. Despite some limitations, including struggles in low light conditions and detection of drowsiness in drivers who wear glasses, the model has achieved some success when well-lit and movement is minimal.
